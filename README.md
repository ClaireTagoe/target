#Sale Sniper

Target Women in Technology Symposium Hackathon Project

By Natalie Euley, Tiffany Fong, Emily Pantuso, and Claire Tagoe

Our project updates users on when their desired items are on sale. Users enter a product URL from Target.com, adding that product to their wish list. Then, our algorithm checks whether that item is discounted and displays the results.

This is a Java application that utilizes Target's API. In the future, we may want to convert this to a mobile app.
